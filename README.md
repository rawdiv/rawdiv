Hello, I’m **Div**, the founder of **Quant Network**. I'm building an innovative blockchain ecosystem that integrates artificial intelligence, decentralized finance, and robotics. The journey started with the creation of **QNTX Token** on the **Binance Smart Chain** (BSC), and soon, the **Quant Network** will transition to its own blockchain. This initiative aims to provide developers with powerful tools and create a fully autonomous and decentralized network.

## My Vision

At **Quant Network**, I aim to create a platform that bridges the gap between **blockchain**, **AI**, and **robotics**. The goal is to build a **scalable**, **secure**, and **decentralized** ecosystem that can power real-world applications.

The **QNTX Token** is the foundation of this ecosystem, serving as both a utility and governance token within the network. Soon, **Quant Network** will launch its own blockchain, providing even more flexibility and scalability for developers and users alike.

## Technologies

I use a combination of technologies to bring **Quant Network** to life:

- **Solidity**: For smart contract development (QNTX Token, governance, and other contracts)
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts
- **OpenZeppelin**: Battle-tested libraries for security in ERC-20/BEP-20 token contracts
- **Ethers.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum and BSC blockchain
- **Node.js**: Backend environment for scripts and server-side logic

## Current Focus

1. **Token Deployment**: Deploying **QNTX Token** on **BSC Testnet** and **Mainnet**
2. **Blockchain Infrastructure**: Preparing for the transition to the **Quant Network**'s private blockchain
3. **AI & Robotics Integration**: Exploring innovative uses of blockchain with AI and robotics to create a decentralized ecosystem

## Features

### QNTX Token
- **Token Standard**: BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain)
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000 QNTX Tokens
- **Minting**: Owner-only minting functionality
- **Burning**: Token holders can burn their own tokens
- **Decentralized**: Plans to expand into a fully decentralized blockchain in the future

### Future Development
- **Quant Blockchain**: Launching a dedicated blockchain for **Quant Network** in the coming months
- **Robotic Network**: Integrating AI-driven robots into the ecosystem
- **Developer Tools**: Building tools that will enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) with ease
